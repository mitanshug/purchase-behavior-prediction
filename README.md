# Customer Purchase Behavior Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting customer purchase behavior using the [Predict Customer Purchase Behavior dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/predict-customer-purchase-behavior-dataset) from Kaggle.

## About the Dataset
The dataset provides information on customer purchase behavior across various attributes, aiming to help data scientists and analysts understand the factors influencing purchase decisions.  
It includes:
- Demographic information (e.g., age, gender, income level)  
- Purchasing habits (e.g., number of purchases, discounts availed)  
- Behavioral patterns (e.g., time spent on website, loyalty program status)

## Project Goals

- Explore the dataset  
- Train multiple ML models
- Evaluate models using metrics
- Provide insights into the most influential factors affecting customer purchase decisions

## Why This Project Matters
Understanding and predicting customer purchase behavior is critical for businesses across industries. Accurate predictions can help organizations identify customers most likely to purchase and tailor offers or promotions to them, while also spotting customers less likely to purchase and designing retention strategies. E-commerce platforms and food delivery apps can apply such models in real time. For example, if the model detects that a customer browsing the app is unlikely to complete a purchase, it can instantly trigger a personalized coupon, free delivery offer, or limited-time discount â€” turning hesitation into conversion and boosting sales.
